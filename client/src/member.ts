//   (identity.md section 3, "Pinning"). The Sphere's own claims (its key lists, its key ids) are

// - Sending: a request to a member whose card it trusts and that accepts the type, a reply to a
//   trusted member that keeps the exchange rules; sealed whenever the receiver's trusted card has a
//   seal key (protocol.md 9.1). Each receipt is kept, checked against the envelope sent.
// - Receiving: each delivery checked as protocol.md section 10 says, signed with a key a trusted
//   card of its sender named, its words opened and handed over as DataText.

//   own sends this member kept (sphere-api.md section 7.1).
//
// Nothing here acts on what a message says: the words are data, for the caller to show or quote.
