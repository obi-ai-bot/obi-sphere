# Sphere server

The Sphere of the Obi-to-Obi protocol v0.1: a team's directory, invitations and pairing, tokens (OAuth on-behalf-of), policy, store-and-forward relay and audit chain. It implements [`../spec/sphere-api.md`](../spec/sphere-api.md) and nothing else; where this code and the spec disagree, the spec wins.

TypeScript on Cloudflare Workers with one D1 database, the same toolchain as Obi's control plane (`cloud/control-plane/` in obi-ai-bot/obi): pnpm, wrangler, and vitest inside workerd (Miniflare) through `@cloudflare/vitest-plugin`.

## Run it

Node 22.18 or later and pnpm. The spec's packages are needed for the conformance suite and the scenario.

```sh
(cd ../spec && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile)
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

SPHERE_OPERATOR_TOKEN=<at least 32 random characters> \
  node scripts/local.mjs --port 8787 --persist-to /path/to/state   # a Sphere on 127.0.0.1:8787
```

`node scripts/local.mjs` ([scripts/local.mjs](scripts/local.mjs)) applies the D1 migrations to the local database under `--persist-to`, then starts the Worker on `127.0.0.1:<port>` with the same `--persist-to` through wrangler's own dev server ([scripts/serve-local.mjs](scripts/serve-local.mjs), wrangler's programmatic API, which `wrangler dev` itself runs on) and the operator token as a Worker secret, never in a file. It is ready when `GET /v0.1/health` answers `200`, and stops with all its descendants when that Node PID receives SIGINT or SIGTERM. Supervisors must launch Node directly; `pnpm run local` remains an interactive convenience, whose signal forwarding varies by platform and pnpm version. It writes only under `--persist-to`, `server/.wrangler/`, `node_modules/`, `$HOME` and `$TMPDIR`, and sends no metrics. Wrangler's Local Explorer and local observability are off, so nothing on the port reaches the D1 without going through the Sphere's checks (`/cdn-cgi/local/explorer` answers `404`). There is no DevTools inspector either: `wrangler dev` always opens one (`127.0.0.1:9229`, no token, and a debugger on it runs code inside the Worker with the D1 binding) and has no flag to turn it off, which is why the Worker is started through the API with `inspector: false`. The other loopback ports wrangler opens are the Worker's own socket (the same Sphere and checks) and Miniflare's internal ones, which answer `403` without Miniflare's per-run secret. `pnpm run scenario` checks all of this in step 1.

## Check it

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `pnpm run check` | TypeScript. |
| `pnpm test` | The Worker's tests inside workerd with a real D1 ([test/](test/)): every endpoint and the errors the spec gives for it (`429 rate_limited` with `Retry-After` only when a record could not be made because of concurrent writes, nothing recorded; `500 internal` for any other failure, also nothing recorded), each send check in its order, the exchange rules, retries, rotation and revocation, concurrent writers (a send that loses its turn more than ten times still lands; one kept out past its budget answers `429`; a constraint failure that isn't contention answers `500` at once and is logged), and every answer validated against its wire schema. |
| `pnpm run conformance` | The spec's conformance suite in implementation mode (`node ../spec/conformance/run.mjs --impl "node conformance/check.ts"`), all case kinds: envelopes, cards and chains, judged by the server's own protocol code. |
| `pnpm run scenario` | The Sphere-side steps of obi's `e2e/SCENARIO.md` (1, 3, 5 and 7, with what 2, 6 and 8 need of the Sphere) against a Sphere started with `node scripts/local.mjs`, by a scripted client ([e2e/client.mjs](e2e/client.mjs)) that plays both owners and both Obis with keys it generates. It checks every relayed message with the spec's reference `verifyEnvelope` and the chain with `verifyChain`. With `OBI_SPHERE_URL` and `SPHERE_OPERATOR_TOKEN` it runs against a deployed Sphere instead, in a fresh Sphere `e2e-<hex>`, without the local-only checks. |
| `pnpm run load -- --sends 200` | [e2e/load.mjs](e2e/load.mjs): that many valid sends fired at once at a Sphere started with `node scripts/local.mjs` (with `--node`, the Node process the container runs); passes only when every one is answered `202` and the chain holds each once and verifies. |
| `pnpm run test:node` | [e2e/node-sphere.test.mjs](e2e/node-sphere.test.mjs): the Sphere as one Node process ([node/main.ts](node/main.ts), what the container image runs), started for real: the one-time claim (only the token's hash kept, `0600`), the HTTPS rule, the phone relay's sockets passing frames unchanged, and a restart that keeps the claim and the Spheres. |
| `pnpm run test:shutdown` | PID-only SIGINT and SIGTERM stop the real launcher, health endpoint and all descendants on Linux and macOS. |
| `pnpm run test:client` | The scripted client's own tests (what it signs passes the reference verifier) and the fixture check's tests. |
| `pnpm run check:fixtures` | [e2e/fixtures/](e2e/fixtures/) still equal obi's `e2e/fixtures/messages/brief.json` and the `body` of `result.example.json` ([e2e/fixtures.mjs](e2e/fixtures.mjs)). It needs an obi checkout (`OBI_DIR`, or `../obi` beside obi-sphere) and fails without one. The scenario makes the same comparison whenever it finds a checkout, and stops on a difference. |
| `pnpm run check:validators` | [src/protocol/validators.generated.js](src/protocol/validators.generated.js) is up to date with `../spec/schemas/v0.1` (`pnpm run gen:validators` rewrites it). |

CI runs all of them ([.github/workflows/server.yml](../.github/workflows/server.yml)); `check:fixtures` only when the repository secret `OBI_READ_TOKEN` exists. Without it the run stays green but says so twice: a warning annotation, and a line in the job summary that the fixture comparison was skipped.

**Blocked on a person:** the secret `OBI_READ_TOKEN` doesn't exist yet. Someone with admin rights on obi-ai-bot/obi-sphere creates a fine-grained token with Contents: read on obi-ai-bot/obi only, and adds it as this repository's Actions secret `OBI_READ_TOKEN`. Until then CI doesn't compare [e2e/fixtures/](e2e/fixtures/) with obi's; run `pnpm run check:fixtures` locally with an obi checkout instead.

## How it is built

- [src/protocol/](src/protocol/): the protocol's checks, the same code in the Worker and in the conformance checker (Node runs the `.ts` files as they are): strict JSON (no duplicate names, integers only) and RFC 8785 canonical JSON, Ed25519 through WebCrypto, envelope checks (protocol.md section 10), the exchange rules, agent cards (identity.md 2.2), compact JWS, and the audit chain's hashes and verification. The JSON Schemas are compiled ahead of time by ajv into one module (Workers allow no code generation at run time).
- [src/app.ts](src/app.ts) routes the API; [src/oauth.ts](src/oauth.ts) is the token exchange; [src/routes/](src/routes/) the rest, each check in the order the spec gives it.
- [migrations/](migrations/): D1's tables. Every change a send depends on (the chain's head, members and keys, the policy) is one transaction guarded by the Sphere's revision, so concurrent writers never interleave: the chain stays one chain, an exchange gets at most one `accept`, an invitation is redeemed once. A send reads everything its checks need in one transaction, checks the signature once, and when another write took its turn it waits a random time under a ceiling that doubles with each loss, then reads again ([src/db.ts](src/db.ts)). Only a lost turn counts as contention: the guard is a named CHECK (`lost_turn`), and its failure is the one failure that is read again and retried. If the record still could not be made because of concurrent writes when the budget runs out, the answer is `429 rate_limited` with `Retry-After`, nothing recorded. Any other failure of a write, a constraint included (a duplicate generated id, a schema mistake), is answered `500 internal` at once, nothing recorded, and the Worker's log says which constraint failed (only table, column and constraint names, never what a client sent).
- Message text is data. The Sphere checks a message's schema and signature and relays it as the sender signed it; it never reads, logs or interprets a text field. Error answers never echo what a client sent beyond a cleaned, one-line excerpt.
- A deliveries call with `wait` and nothing queued sleeps on its Obi's Doorbell ([src/doorbell.ts](src/doorbell.ts)), a Durable Object that hibernates while it waits, and a send rings the recipient's once its delivery is recorded: two looks at D1 per long poll, whatever its `wait`.
- The phone relay ([src/relay.ts](src/relay.ts), spec section 9): a Durable Object per relay holds a member's Mac's WebSocket and one per paired phone, and passes their end-to-end sealed frames between them without reading, keeping or logging any. The Sphere keeps only each phone's relay-token SHA-256.
- Secrets: invitation secrets and access tokens are kept only as SHA-256; the operator token is a Worker secret, compared in constant time and never logged. No telemetry: observability is off in `wrangler.jsonc` and wrangler sends no metrics.

## Deploying

Off Cloudflare, the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) runs the same code as one Node process ([node/](node/): SQLite in place of D1, the Doorbell and the phone relay in memory, no job channels), claimed once from a link in its log: [docs/self-host-docker.md](../docs/self-host-docker.md).

The Deploy to Cloudflare button ([docs/run-your-own.md](../docs/run-your-own.md)) copies this folder into the deployer's own repository and builds it in Cloudflare's Workers Builds, where `pnpm run deploy` applies the migrations and deploys the neutral top level of [`wrangler.jsonc`](wrangler.jsonc); the operator token is the secret the button asks for ([.dev.vars.example](.dev.vars.example), described in `package.json`'s `cloudflare.bindings`). By hand, a person's step: one environment block in `wrangler.jsonc`, then `pnpm run deploy -- --env <name>` ([scripts/deploy.mjs](scripts/deploy.mjs): the D1 database and migrations, the Worker, and an operator token kept in the Keychain). Outside Workers Builds (`WORKERS_CI=1`) `--env` is required. Deskree's: [docs/deploy-cloudflare.md](../docs/deploy-cloudflare.md).
