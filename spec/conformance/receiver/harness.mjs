// The receiver track: a harness that starts a local Sphere, enrolls the implementation under test
// through its adapter command, and runs the cases (cases.mjs and a corpus of adversarial payloads)
// against it with scripted peers. See conformance/README.md, "The receiver track".
//
// Pass and fail are judged only from what reached a peer — read from the Sphere's audit chain,
// verified and its words opened as the addressee would (peer.mjs, readRecord) — and from the case's
// own markers: files a payload asked the receiver to write, and requests to a loopback address a
// payload pointed at (markers.mjs). The harness itself follows nothing a payload says; it watches
// what the receiver did.
