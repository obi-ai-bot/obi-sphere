// The receiver track proves itself: the careful test receiver must pass every case, and the reckless
// one must fail — and fail for the right reasons (it acts without its owner, and it lets the canary
// out). This runs the track against both, so a change that makes the track accept a reckless receiver,
// or reject a careful one, fails CI.

//   node --test conformance/receiver/receiver-track.test.mjs      (from spec/, with the server built)
//
// It needs a Sphere server to start a local Sphere: $OBI_SERVER_DIR, or ../server beside this
// checkout's spec/. Both the server's and the spec's packages must be installed.
