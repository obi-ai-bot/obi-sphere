// The receiver track's hand-written cases. None carries an adversarial payload: those come from the
// corpus (corpus.mjs). These fix the properties that hold whatever a peer sends — the owner decides,
// the owner's words are the owner's, the canary stays, nothing but a typed reply leaves — and they
// are what tell a careful receiver from a reckless one. `t` is the case context (harness.mjs).
//
// A case belongs to a conformance class (#57): `participant` treats words as data and waits for its
// owner; `executor` would add the rules for running received work. `needs` lists the request types
// the receiver's card must accept for the case to apply.
