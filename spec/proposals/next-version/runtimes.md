# Runtime and vendor ids: open, bounded, with a registry

Status: **Draft**, part of [the next protocol version](README.md). Issue: [#54](https://github.com/obi-ai-bot/oby-sphere/issues/54), the part it leaves for a breaking version.

## 1. Where `obi/0.1` stands

- **`agent`, a closed enum.** `run_request.agent`, `share_offer.agent` and a runner status's `agents` take `claude` or `codex` and nothing else, so every other runtime can't be named. Widening it behind a feature would be an addition (spec/README.md, "Versions", rule 1). With those actions retired, there is no reason to.
- **The card's runtime and vendors, open from the start.** The #54 addition, under review as #70, adds them to `obi/0.1` behind the feature `card_runtime`: `params.runtime` is `{id, version}`, `params.vendors` is a list of distinct vendor ids, and both kinds of id match `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`. With it, identity.md keeps an open list of known runtime ids (`claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, `gemini`, `goose`, `opencode`, `copilot`, `oby`), with `claude` and `codex` the same strings as the `agent` enum's, and the card gains `features`, which later additions use.

## 2. In the next version

**There is no `agent` enum left to open** if the compute and share actions are dropped ([D4](README.md#decisions-for-the-maintainers)): `run_request`, `share_offer` and the runner status were its only uses. The runtime a member runs is said once, on its card, by the open id #54 adds. If those actions were kept as a profile instead, their `agent` field would become `runtime`, typed as the same runtime id, so `agent` always means a member ([identifiers.md](identifiers.md#1-every-product-named-identifier)) and `claude` and `codex` stay valid values.

**The card** carries `runtime` and `vendors` as Core fields, no longer behind a feature, in the shape #54 gives them:

```json
{
  "runtime_id": {
    "description": "An agent runtime: open, bounded. The registry lists the known ones; any other id that matches is valid.",
    "type": "string",
    "minLength": 1,
    "maxLength": 64,
    "pattern": "^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$"
  },
  "vendor_id": {
    "description": "A model vendor: open, bounded, the same way.",
    "type": "string",
    "minLength": 1,
    "maxLength": 64,
    "pattern": "^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$"
  }
}
```

Both are identifiers, not words: a closed pattern, so they can key a rule, be counted and be shown without being read as data.

## 3. The registry (D12)

The spec lists the ids it knows, so that two implementations call the same runtime by the same id. A machine-readable copy sits next to the schemas (`registry/runtimes.json`, `registry/vendors.json`), and the text lists the same entries.

```json
{
  "runtimes": [
    { "id": "claude", "name": "Claude Code" },
    { "id": "codex", "name": "Codex CLI" },
    { "id": "cursor", "name": "Cursor" }
  ],
  "vendors": [
    { "id": "anthropic", "name": "Anthropic" },
    { "id": "openai", "name": "OpenAI" },
    { "id": "google", "name": "Google" }
  ]
}
```

**Recommended rules:**

1. **Open on the wire.** Any id that matches the pattern is valid in a card or a message. A runtime nobody here has heard of can be named, which is #54's done-when, and a receiver never refuses a message for an id it doesn't know.
2. **Listed by pull request, first come.** Whoever builds a runtime, or anyone on its behalf, adds its id with its name. An id is never reused for something else and never taken away; a runtime that is gone stays listed. The maintainers refuse an id that would mislead: another project's name, or a name chosen to look like one.
3. **Declared, not proven.** A card's `runtime` and `vendors` are what its owner signed, as #54 says. The registry says what an id means, not that a member runs it: anyone can declare a listed vendor, and the Council's calibration is what catches a false declaration.
4. **Unlisted vendors count for no vendor.** The Council's rule I4 counts distinct model vendors on a panel. A vendor id the registry doesn't list counts for none of them: otherwise anyone could meet a diversity constraint by declaring a vendor that doesn't exist, which is cheaper still than declaring a listed one falsely. A seat whose only vendors are unlisted may still sit, and adds no vendor to the count. Unlisted runtime ids count for nothing either; I4 counts vendors, not runtimes.
5. **One vendor per seat, per motion.** A card may list several vendors, the ones its member may use. For a motion, each pool entry's own member names the **one** vendor it will assess with, from its card's `vendors`, signed when it enters the pool, and that is the vendor it counts for. The convener never chooses it, so the convener can't steer the count. It is fixed and hashed with the pool, before the seed is known (council/process.md, steps 2 and 3, whose pool record already lists one declared vendor per entry). Otherwise one seat listing three vendors would meet a three-vendor minimum alone.

**The alternative**, a closed list that only the maintainers extend, would bring back the problem #54 removes: a new runtime couldn't take part until a pull request merged. Rule 4 gives the Council the protection a closed list would, where it matters.

## 4. Done when

#54's done-when has three parts. A card says "runtime X, vendors A and B": the #54 addition. The Council draw counts vendors from it: the draw, with rules 4 and 5 above. A runtime nobody here has heard of can be named in a request: with the compute and share actions dropped, no request names a runtime any more, so this part has nothing left to apply to. The maintainers are asked to accept that, or, if those actions are kept, the next version's open `runtime` field meets it.
