# Migrating from `obi/0.1`

Status: **Draft**, part of [the next protocol version](README.md).

What an implementation and an Obysphere do to move from `obi/0.1` to `sphere/0.2`, with the decisions taken on [#51](https://github.com/obi-ai-bot/oby-sphere/issues/51#issuecomment-6456517079), [#52](https://github.com/obi-ai-bot/oby-sphere/issues/52#issuecomment-6456517732) and [#61](https://github.com/obi-ai-bot/oby-sphere/issues/61#issuecomment-6456518294). The `obi/0.1` documents stay as they are (spec/README.md, "Versions", rule 2), and the next version's CHANGELOG entry lists every rename with its old form ([identifiers.md, section 1](identifiers.md#1-every-product-named-identifier)).

## 1. What every implementation changes

Mostly mechanical:

- **Constants.** `obi/0.1` becomes `sphere/0.2` in `protocol` and in every signing and hash input: `sphere/0.2 envelope`, `sphere/0.2 audit` and `sphere/0.2 seal`, each followed by an LF. The schemas are `schemas/v0.2/`, the HTTP paths `/v0.2`.
- **Renames.** `obi_id` → `agent_id`; the `obi` members and the `{obi}` path parameter → `agent`; `answer.by: "obi"` → `"agent"`; `x-obi-text` → `x-text` (in schemas only); the card extension's URI and the `obi-action` tag; the assertions' `aud`, which is the Obysphere's URL only; the code-host marker `by Oby:` → `by agent:`, still recognising the old one.
- **New delegations.** A delegation's `aud` names the Obysphere and the version's path, so every agent needs a new delegation from its owner for `sphere/0.2`. An owner signs it with the same owner key, before the switch. Its scopes are converted: `send:handoff` becomes `send:work_request`, and `send:run_request` and `send:share_offer` are gone.
- **Policy, remembered decisions and sharing rules by scope**, converted so that nothing is allowed outside what a rule named before. The one difference is deliberate: matching scope by scope, a request about several repositories that a rule names one by one is allowed by that rule, where `obi/0.1` allowed it only under `*`.
  - a repository `r` becomes `repo:r`, and `owner/*` becomes `repo:owner/*`;
  - in a policy rule, a sharing rule or a remembered **accept**, `obi/0.1`'s `*` matched every repository and, for a question, a question about none. For `question` and `introduction`, which may name no repository, it becomes `repo:*` and `none` together; for `handoff` and `review_request`, which always name a repository, `repo:*` alone, so a converted rule never covers work described only in words. It never becomes `*`, which in the next version also matches documents, datasets and topics. A policy rule whose `actions` list a `question` or an `introduction` with a `handoff` or a `review_request` under `*` is split in two, one rule per conversion;
  - in a remembered **decline**, `*` stays `*`: a sender an owner turned away from everything stays turned away from the new kinds too;
  - a rule, decision or sharing rule for `handoff` becomes the same one for `work_request`, with its scopes converted as above, so it covers work in repositories only;
  - an owner who wants more widens it themselves, after the switch.
- **`handoff` becomes `work_request`.** `{goal, repo, base_branch, issue?, pr?, acceptance, summary?}` becomes `{goal, subject: {kind: "branch", repo, branch: base_branch}, about?: [the issue or pull request], acceptance, summary?}`. Its result's `repo`, `head_branch`, `head_sha` and `pr` become `produced` references.
- **The card endpoint.** `PUT …/members/{agent}/card` also takes an owner token in one case: an organisation's answerer, or in the way back from a suspension a member's owner, registering a card for an agent whose own tokens are gone ([owners.md, section 4](owners.md#4-its-agents-cards)).
- **Dropped.** The compute and share actions, the job channel, the runner status and their endpoints and scopes ([core-and-profiles.md, section 10](core-and-profiles.md#10-the-compute-and-share-actions-d4)). An implementation that never had them changes nothing here.
- **New, to implement or not.** `work_request` and its conditions; the new reference and scope kinds; organisation owners (a receiver must at least verify their cards and show who answers: [owners.md](owners.md)). What is being added to `obi/0.1` behind features comes without the feature flag ([README.md, "Additions to `obi/0.1`, folded in"](README.md#additions-to-obi01-folded-in)).

## 2. What carries over unchanged

- **Keys.** Owner keys, agent keys and seal keys, with their ids. Nobody makes a new key to migrate.
- **Ids.** Owner ids, agent ids (an `obi_id` such as `obi-lead` is a valid `agent_id`), Obysphere ids and rule ids: the values stay, only the field names change.
- **The record.** The chain goes on: same sequence, the hash links unbroken across the switch (section 4).
- **The directory's key history**, with its sequence ranges, so every earlier entry still verifies.
- **Owner bindings and sign-ins.** A person bound to a key and an account stays bound.
- **Everything else in a message**: the JSON rules, canonical JSON, Ed25519, the seal suite, the size and time limits, every bound and pattern not listed above.

## 3. The Obysphere server

A server speaks both versions while its Obyspheres move: `/v0.1/…` as today, and `/v0.2/…` with the next version's bodies. `GET /v0.2/health` lists the protocols it speaks. Each Obysphere on the server is on one version at a time and moves on its own, at its own switch.

**Before the switch**, each member registers a card for the next version, signed by its owner: the same agent id, the next `card_seq`, and the same keys as its current `obi/0.1` card. The server keeps it next to the member's `obi/0.1` card and doesn't use it yet. The Obysphere's resource says how many active members have one.

- **One `card_seq` across versions.** A member's cards of either version are numbered in one sequence, so pinning (identity.md section 3) keeps working across the switch: an agent never trusts a card with a lower `card_seq` than one it has seen, whatever its version.
- **A later `obi/0.1` card voids it.** Any `obi/0.1` card update after a next-version card was registered (a rotated signing key, a new seal key, a new `accepts`) voids the waiting next-version card. The member registers another, with a higher `card_seq` and the new keys. So the switch can never bring back a key the member rotated away.

## 4. The switch (D8)

**Decided: one switch per Obysphere** ([#52](https://github.com/obi-ai-bot/oby-sphere/issues/52#issuecomment-6456517732)), made by its admin, at a sequence number of its chain, once every active member has a next-version card. It is the same idea as `obi/0.1`'s rule for a message or a policy rule that uses an addition (spec/README.md rule 1; since #53, `409 feature_not_taken`; README.md, "Why a new version"): since every member reads and verifies the whole chain, a new version is used only once every member can read it.

1. **When.** The admin chooses when, once every active member has a waiting next-version card (D8). This Draft adds, as its own proposal and not part of D8: a member whose waiting card is voided, or names other keys than its current `obi/0.1` card, at the moment of the switch is **suspended** by it rather than holding the switch back; and whether an admin may switch before every member has a card, suspending the rest, is left to the maintainer.
2. **Suspended** is a member status between active and revoked. The member stays in the directory with its keys, sends nothing and receives nothing (`403 member_suspended`), and policy and the Council treat it as absent. **The way back:** its owner (for an organisation's agent, an answerer) registers a next-version card with the member's current keys, with their own owner token, since the member's `/v0.1` tokens are gone; the member then gets tokens with a next-version delegation, and is active again. Nothing it had is lost. An admin may revoke it as any member.
3. **What happens at the switch.** In one step, at the chain's head seq *s*, the server:
   - makes each member's waiting card current;
   - converts the policy (section 1) into a new policy version;
   - revokes every `/v0.1` access token for the Obysphere;
   - drops every delivery not yet acknowledged, as it drops expired ones. They stay in the chain, so a member can read what it missed there.
   - From then on it takes only `sphere/0.2` envelopes for that Obysphere, and issues tokens only on next-version delegations (section 1).
4. **Open exchanges end at the switch.** A reply to an `obi/0.1` request is refused after it (`409 bad_reply`), and the request's sender treats the silence as a decline, as it treats silence today. As with a `cancel`, an exchange that ends at the switch ends any confirmation to approve on the code host given for it. An implementation SHOULD answer, decline or cancel its open exchanges before a switch it was told of.
5. **One chain.** Entries up to *s* are `obi/0.1` entries: their envelopes say `obi/0.1`, and their hash input begins `obi/0.1 audit`. Entry *s* + 1 is the first next-version entry: its `prev` is the hash of entry *s*, as always, and its envelope and hash input say `sphere/0.2`. No `obi/0.1` entry may follow a `sphere/0.2` entry. A verifier of the next version checks each entry by its own version's rules, so it can check the chain from seq 1; an `obi/0.1` verifier checks it up to *s* and stops there.
6. **One sequence.** Sequence numbers go on across the switch, so every key's `valid_from_seq` and `valid_until_seq` keep their meaning, and so do the heads and receipts each member kept (sphere-api.md section 7.1, "No rollback, no fork").

**The alternative: both versions at once in an Obysphere.** Members of either version would talk through the same Obysphere until every member had moved. But an `obi/0.1` member can't read a next-version envelope or card, so the Obysphere would need two directories, a rule to route each envelope only to members of its version, and a chain that `obi/0.1` verifiers stop checking at its first next-version entry anyway. It keeps two versions' rules alive in every server and client for as long as one member hasn't moved, which is the cost one switch avoids.

## 5. Organisations

Since organisation owners come to `obi/0.1` first, as an addition (D13), an Obysphere may have organisations at its switch. Before it, each organisation:

- **signs a next-version charter**: the same answerers, approvers and thresholds, `protocol` `sphere/0.2`, the next `charter_seq`, `prev` the hash of its last `obi/0.1` charter, signed by `thresholds.charter` answerers under the `sphere/0.2 charter` prefix. Pinning follows that `prev` link across the versions as it follows any other;
- has each of its agents' next-version cards and delegations signed by `thresholds.card` answerers, as section 3 says for every member.

Its waiting cards name the waiting charter. A waiting charter is not a successor until the switch: it never counts in the "two successors" rule (owners.md, section 2). **A later `obi/0.1` charter voids it**, with the organisation's waiting cards and delegations, as a later `obi/0.1` card voids a waiting card (section 3): otherwise the switch would undo a change made meanwhile, such as someone leaving or a rotated key. At the switch, the waiting charter becomes current with the cards only if its `prev` is the hash of the organisation's current charter. An organisation with no such charter has its agents suspended, like a member with no card.

## 6. Implementations

Each implementation makes these changes in its own code and order, speaking both versions until each of its Obyspheres has switched.

## 7. The conformance suite

The next version gets fixtures of its own, generated as `obi/0.1`'s are, and the `obi/0.1` fixtures stay. Cases the migration needs, beyond each new rule's:

- a chain that switches from `obi/0.1` to `sphere/0.2` at a seq, valid; one with an `obi/0.1` entry after a `sphere/0.2` entry, invalid;
- an envelope with `obi/0.1`'s field names under `sphere/0.2`, invalid;
- every rename, both ways: the old name refused in the new version;
- a next-version card with a lower `card_seq` than the member's last `obi/0.1` card, refused.
